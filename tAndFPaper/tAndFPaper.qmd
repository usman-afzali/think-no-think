abstract: |
  During the past two decades, Anderson and colleagues continuously reported significant No-Think suppression effect - also known as suppression-induced forgetting - with behavioural as well as neurophysiological studies. Notwithstanding, many researchers, including Wessel et al.  (2020. A multiverse analysis of early attempts to replicate memory suppression with the Think/No-think Task, . 870-887) reported failed replications of this effect. Here, we report two studies examining the Think/No-Think paradigm. In Study 1 ($N = 46$) we report significant suppression-induced forgetting effect despite a smaller frequency of suppression attempts (compared to Anderson) as a result of \textit{behavioural only} experiments. In the pre-registered Study 2, we examined the Think/No-Think paradigm in relation to psychological traits: obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. In Study 2, after screening $N = 367$ subjects, we recruited the highest and lowest scorers on Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and PTSD-CheckList - Civilian Version scale ($N = 75$) employing the Think/No-Think paradigm . Overall, we report successful suppression-induced forgetting effect, and that the low trait scorers were relatively more capable of forgetting unwanted memories than the high trait scorers. In addition, our studies demonstrate opposing patterns of the Think manipulation effect with respect to the type of testing with the original cue versus an independent cue, suggestive of the cognitive bias, \textit{functional fixedness}.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This is an example of how to use this template to render journal articles. This template is inspired by the Taylor and Francis rticles template for rmarkdown, repurposed for the Quarto publishing system.

This quarto extension format supports PDF and HTML outputs. This template is primarily focused on generating acceptable {{< latex >}} outputs from Quarto, but renders an acceptable HTML output using the standard Quarto options.

# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

This format hide chunks by default, but you can set `echo` option to `true` locally in the chunk:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: tbl-glm
#| tbl-cap: "A table."

# install.packages("broom")
# install.packages("kableExtra")
data("quine", package = "MASS")
m_pois <- glm(Days ~ (Eth + Sex + Age + Lrn)^2, data = quine, family = poisson)
kableExtra::kable_styling(
  kableExtra::kbl(broom::tidy(m_pois))
)
```

# Markdown Basics

This section of the template is adapted from [Quarto's documentation on Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

## Headings {#headings}

+--------------------+----------------------------------+
| Markdown Syntax    | Output                           |
+====================+==================================+
| ```                | # Header 1 {.heading-output}     |
| # Header 1         |                                  |

## Equations

Use `$` delimiters for inline math and `$$` delimiters for display math. For example:

+------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Markdown Syntax              | Output                  |
+==============================+=========================+
| ```                          | inline math: $E=mc^{2}$ |
| inline math: $E = mc^{2}$    |                         |
| ```                          |                         |
+------------------------------+-------------------------+
| ```                          | display math:\          |
| display math:                | $$E = mc^{2}$$          |
|                              |                         |
| $$E = mc^{2}$$               |                         |
| ```                          |                         |
+------------------------------+-------------------------+

If assigned an ID, display math equations will be automatically numbered:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}

See the [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) documentation for additional information on citation syntax.

To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the `csl` metadata field in your document, for example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: nature.csl
---
```
