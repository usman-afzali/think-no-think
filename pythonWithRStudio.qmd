## Preparation
We need to install `reticulate` and activate it.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Since python is already installed, create a virtual environment here.

```{r}
use_virtualenv("my_python", required = TRUE)
```

Use the following code to install python libraries.

**Pandas**

```{r}
virtualenv_install(envname = "my_python", "pandas", ignore_installed = FALSE, pip_options = character())
```

**Open Excel with Python**

```{r}
virtualenv_install(envname = "my_python", "openpyxl", ignore_installed = FALSE, pip_options = character())
```

Now, we can run python on R. If any further libraries are needed, they need to be installed as above.
